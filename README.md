helping farmers
Agricultural productivity and sustainability are essential for meeting the global food demand. In recent years, the application of machine learning techniques in agriculture has shown
great promise in assisting farmers with informed decision-making. This abstract presents a
crop recommendation system that utilizes machine learning algorithms in combination with
N-P-K (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) values to provide tailored crop recommendations based on soil conditions. Through supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees,
random forests, or support vector machines, the model establishes relationships between crop
performance and N-P-K values
